# Lesson 1: Build a Text-Only Web Page

## Learning objectives
Introduce the concept of programming and discuss the different things programmers do, focus on the specific case of building websites and have students edit a simple HTML file with text, putting programming into a real world context as a result.

## Key Vocabulary
Programming, HTML, Browser, Terminal, Editor, tags

## Delivery of content

### Concept of programming (Lecture)
When you write a program, you are giving a computer a series of commands that kind of looks like a weird form of English. Tell the students to think of a computer as a really obedient dog, listening to your commands and doing whatever you tell it to do. Thankfully, programming isn’t some obscure skill that only special people can do. It’s something we can all do. Kids, teens, adults, from all over the world are learning programming today.

People who write programs is:
- Helping doctors to cure diseases.
- Helping save endangered species.
- Making self-driving cars.
- Designing robots that can take care of the patients or drive around Mars and look for water in the surface.

### HTML (Lecture)
HTML is a programming language and the tags are the commands that we give to the computer and the computer understand them. We use this programming language to build websites. Ask the students about websites they know and/or use. Tell them they could build the next Google or Facebook.

### HTML tags (Audio-Visual)
- Show the students that to begin any web page, we need to type <HTML>. This tells the computer to start reading their web page.
- Then teach them the end tag </html>. This tells the computer to stop reading their web page.
- Explain opening bracket and close bracket. The students then to like calling < "less than" and > "greater than".
- Write ```<b> I love code </b> It is great``` between the HTML tags and ask the students to guess what part will show bold.

### Creating the web page (Practice by doing)
- First introduce the concept of browser. Explain that it allows you to view pages. Ask them to find the browser in the computer to make sure they know where it is.
- Next help them navigate to their terminal and open that. Have them type in "gedit index.html" and press return.
- Ask then what they see now.
- Ask them to type in the first command and explain that it tells the computer that it's going to start reading a web page:
```
<html>
```
- Have them press return a few times and then ask if anyone remembers what the command is to tell the computer to stop reading the web page:
- Ask them to type in the first command and explain that it tells the computer that it's going to start reading a web page:
```
<html>


</html>
```
## Key Points for Student Retention
Conduct the following review at the end of the class:
- Who can tell me what HTML is?
- Who can tell me how to open a file called index.html?
- Who can tell me what an HTML tag is?
- Who can tell me how to save a file?
- What is the html tag that tells the computer to start reading a web page?
- What is the html tag that tells the computer to stop reading a web page?

Next class, conduct a review of what they learned last class:
- What this command/tag mean...?
- What is the tag/command to do...?


## Assesment evidence

## Home-learning opportunities
Ask the students to guess what not-yet-introduced HTML tags will do? E.g. after introducing ```<b>``` and ```<u>```, try to guess ```<i>```. Relate with word processing tools, such as Microsoft Word or Google Docs.
Ask the students to practice at home combined tags, display text bold and underlined.
